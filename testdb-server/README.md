# Introduction
This project creates a custom image of a mysql server with a test database (testdb) which can be used to test the concept of capture data changes using mysql transaction logs directly

The testdb is empty, therefore any test app client needs to create the datamodel and feed the data appropriately.

Sample client under tasks-test-client project (../tasks-test-client)
